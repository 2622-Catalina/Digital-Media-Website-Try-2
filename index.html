	<li><em style="">Logo</em></li>
	<p><strong>projects.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Additionally</strong> the artist statement (or a written description of an artist's work to provide context and understanding for the viewer. It explains the artist's motivations, inspirations, and meaning behind the art.</strong> I also made everything look nice, so <em>enjoy!</em></p>
	<p><strong>Alphabet Photography:</strong></p>
<p>My name was given to me by my parents not only because it was my great-grandmother’s, but also because it means “pure” in Spanish and they wanted to give me a name that would guide me to opportunities and possibilities. As a family, we all believe that words and actions have power, which is another reason why they chose that name, for me to be able to see the world as it is and not be deceived by people with ill-intentions.</p>
	<p><strong>No-Face Self Portrait:</strong></p>
<p>In the fall and the winter, I feel like the world has been suspended in time and everything is cold, calm, and more relaxed. I like that and it calms me down. Even though my project does seem a little crazy, with all the different colors and shapes, the beauty is in the chaos. As a student who loves reading, and will read any book, I put books on the border to represent that they enclose my being. I kept the original background of the flower the same because it didn’t need anything added to it, along with the picture of my dog (which I cropped) shows how much she means to me and is part of my core personality. Additionally, the car in the fall background shows my love for taking pictures of cars that I like, whether they’re on the street or somewhere else, I add them to a collection. Also, I LOVE coffee and macarons, so I added those too in order to represent them as a part of me. Lastly, my love for music is shown through a song cover that started my adoration of Brazilian music.</p>
	<p><strong>Visual Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p>The story of my project is the struggle of finding the perfect book to read at a bookstore with so many options. The pictures have an artistic meaning of showing comfort and relaxation while reading a good book and perusing the aisles. I used all the different photography skills, including aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. I also brightened all of the pictures because of the darkness that was an effect of using the different photography settings (which was done in Photoshop).</p>
	<p><strong>Mood Board:</strong></p>
<p>When I created this project, my intention was to evoke a sense of lightness and happiness while also conveying elegance, cheer, and over all, good mood. I happened to witness these emotions whenever I see young women having lunch. In essence, a jovial enviorment. Hence, where the name of the fictional name comes from. Even though Estee Lauder maingly sells perfumes, makeup, and skincare profucts, I decided to develop a clothing line that complimented their collaboration with Lauduree, a renowned macaron patisserie.</p>
	<p><strong>Scavenger Hunt:</strong></p>
<p>My collage depicts a little, miniature garden, complete with small flowers, a bumblebee, and a butterfly, all taken from separate images using the Object Selection Tool in Photoshop. Additionally, there is a basketball in the frame, which shows how humans always have a way of leaving their mark on nature. We have either claimed this little garden as our own or have stumbled upon it after misplacing our basketball. The mossy background of the collage gives it a feeling of wildness, yet also a feeling of controlled beauty. Moreover, The softness of the pink flower with the smoothness of the button evens out the textures and gently guides the eye towards the softly rainbow butterfly.</p>
	<p><strong>AI Art:</strong></p>
<p>I believe I was very successful in recreating my work and made very realistic photos. The art the AI made was good but not better than what I made. It would take several prompts, minimum of 10, to make something remotely appealing. To make something really good, minimum of 30 prompts. AI art could be a replacement for what we do in this class, but should not because people need to harness this skill themselves instead of relying on AI to do it for them. It does not enhance my creativity, it's just creating what I've come up with in its own imagination. It's not my art anymore, it's the AI's art with my idea now. This isn't ethical and I can't win an art competition with it because I no longer participated, the AI participated in my stead. I don't believe AI has any creativity at all. It just takes already existing images and uses that information to create something similar. It is incapable of creating something unique and original itself. Therefore, AI cannot replace human creativity because it didn't have any to start with.</p>
	<p><strong>Logo:</strong></p>
<p>My logos depict my name surrounded by symbols or other drawings. Additionally, there are several different colors in some of the logos, which show the color variety of happiness and comfort. The white background helps the viewer focus on the actual logo while keeping everything professional. Moreover, the simpleness of all the logos create an aesthetically pleasing perspective. Adobe Illustrator was a very frustrating application. It lacks some of the necessary features that Adobe Photoshop had to make things more approachable. Also, Adobe Illustrator didn’t have the feature of Object Selection, which would have made my life much easier when creating the Mood Board based logo. Furthermore, I hope to use a different application on my next project and be able to successfully render my next project with quality instead of the difficulty I faced with Adobe Illustrator.</p>
