<p><strong>Visual Storytelling:</strong></p>
  <p>The story of my project is the struggle of finding the perfect book to read at a bookstore with so many options. The pictures have an artistic meaning of showing comfort and relaxation while reading a good book and perusing the aisles. I used all the different photography skills, including aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. I also brightened all of the pictures because of the darkness that was an effect of using the different photography settings (which was done in Photoshop).</p>
