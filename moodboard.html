<p><strong>Mood Board:</strong></p>
  <p>When I created this project, my intention was to evoke a sense of lightness and happiness while also conveying elegance, cheer, and over all, good mood. I happened to witness these emotions whenever I see young women having lunch. In essence, a jovial enviorment. Hence, where the name of the fictional name comes from. Even though Estee Lauder maingly sells perfumes, makeup, and skincare profucts, I decided to develop a clothing line that complimented their collaboration with Lauduree, a renowned macaron patisserie.</p>
