<p><strong>Scavenger Hunt:</strong></p>
  <p>My collage depicts a little, miniature garden, complete with small flowers, a bumblebee, and a butterfly, all taken from separate images using the Object Selection Tool in Photoshop. Additionally, there is a basketball in the frame, which shows how humans always have a way of leaving their mark on nature. We have either claimed this little garden as our own or have stumbled upon it after misplacing our basketball. The mossy background of the collage gives it a feeling of wildness, yet also a feeling of controlled beauty. Moreover, The softness of the pink flower with the smoothness of the button evens out the textures and gently guides the eye towards the softly rainbow butterfly.</p>
