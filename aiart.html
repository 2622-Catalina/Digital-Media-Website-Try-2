<p><strong>AI Art:</strong></p>
  <p>I believe I was very successful in recreating my work and made very realistic photos. The art the AI made was good but not better than what I made. It would take several prompts, minimum of 10, to make something remotely appealing. To make something really good, minimum of 30 prompts. AI art could be a replacement for what we do in this class, but should not because people need to harness this skill themselves instead of relying on AI to do it for them. It does not enhance my creativity, it's just creating what I've come up with in its own imagination. It's not my art anymore, it's the AI's art with my idea now. This isn't ethical and I can't win an art competition with it because I no longer participated, the AI participated in my stead. I don't believe AI has any creativity at all. It just takes already existing images and uses that information to create something similar. It is incapable of creating something unique and original itself. Therefore, AI cannot replace human creativity because it didn't have any to start with.</p>
